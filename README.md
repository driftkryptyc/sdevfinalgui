    category for type of expense: i.e. rent, food, car etc, once you wrote a name for a category press (Add Category)
    and the program will save it.
3. Repeat step 2 for all categories you will need.
4. Once all Categories are added move o the "Expense Tracker" side.
5. Now you see "Date:", with 3 boxes next to it. The boxes represent Month, Day and Year respectively. Input the date
   for an expense you want to track. next we will pick a category then add a price and save.
6. Next is Category, click the down arrow on the right side of input box to open a drop-down menu with all the categories
   you added in step 2. Pick the correct category for expense you are adding. (you can always add more categories)
